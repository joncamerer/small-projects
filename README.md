Unscramble - Idea taken from technical interview question.  The goal was to return a number (with digits in ascending order) derived from a scrambled string of its digit's english spellings. For example: "nofornineeu" (scrambled "onefournine") should be represented as 149. In this implementation, Unscramble must be initialized with a scrambled word and the provided list of target words. Unscramble.chaseSolution() will return the initial scrambled string and its representation as a number.
