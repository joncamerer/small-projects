SudokuBoard - Generates a fully filled sudoku solution for 9 x 9 puzzles.

Unscramble - Idea taken from technical interview question.  The goal was to return an integer (with digits in ascending order) derived from a scrambled string of the digit's english spellings. For example "nofornineeu" (scrambled "onefournine") should be represented as 149. In this implementation, Unscramble must be initialized with a scrambled word and a list of target words (provided). Unscramble.chaseSolution() will return the initial scrambled string and its representation as an integer.
